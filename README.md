I am a former data analyst/operational researcher with strong technical skills in SQL, Excel and VBA with specialist knowledge related to the education sector. Proven experience of utilising large datasets to provide analytical support to operational colleagues, and to produce indicators to measure the performance of organisations. In addition, I have experience of applying knowledge gained at the Department for Education to support smaller organisations with performance monitoring and evidencing impact for grant funding.

## Skills

#### Communication and stakeholder management

During my career at the Department for Education I have supported non-analytical colleagues in answering questions about policy and operations. I have developed skills in translating non-technical needs into user stories and feature lists, matching these with my knowledge of data and analytics to devise and deliver minimum viable products.

I have also delivered several webinars to promote and document tools I have created.

#### Analysis

Through my various roles at the department for education, I have been able to use my knowledge of data and skills in modelling and forecasting to translate policy and operational questions into decisions backed by data.

#### Additional Skills

- SQL and database design
- Data modelling in Excel and SQL
